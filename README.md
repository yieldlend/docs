# Welcome

YieldLend is a native decentralized lending protocol built on Base ecosystem. YieldLend takes the best of Curve, Solidly, Aave and Radiant Finance, to create incentives that survive long-term growth but is short-term sustainable.

With well designed tokenomics and a community driven fair launch, YieldLend strives to create a sustainable decentralized money market that can out-do other lending markets.

Yield lend builds on top of the:

* **veTokenomics of Curve/Solidly**: Users can stake their YIELD tokens anywhere from 2 weeks to 4 years to have a vested interest in the ecosystem. The more tokens they stake, the bigger the share of rewards they earn.
* **Reward Vesting Mechanics from Radiant Finance:** Users that earn rewards from the protocol in various forms such as staking, farming etc. have their rewards vested. Rewards can be withdrawn early (with a penalty) or staked for 4 years (with a bonus).
* **Money market from Aave:** Users provide liquidity into the money market which is based on Aave v3 to perform basic lending and borrowing. Providing liquidty not only earns liquidity incentives for users, but also generates revenue for the protocol which is used to add to liquidity.

## Key Features of YIELD

Below we briefly sumarise what makes the YIELD token special. To learn more about YIELD and the dynamics of it, you can visit the tokenomics page where each section is explain in detail.

1. **Fair Launch with Bonding Curve:** Early **u**sers that provide liquidity and participate in the protocol's bonding curve launch, will earn the YIELD governance token. To raise liquidity for the YIELD governance token, a bonding curve sale will be conducted.
2. **Deflationary Tax Token:** The protocol is incentivized with the YIELD governance token, a deflationary tax token that uses funds to add to improve protocol liquidity and perform burns.
3. **Vesting for Rewards:** Rewards earned from the protocol are vested linearly across a period of 6 months.
4. **4 Year Staking:** To help in creating scarcity and long-term interest in the protocol, users can participate in the protocol's 4 year staking program.&#x20;
