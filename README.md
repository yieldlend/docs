# Welcome

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

YieldLend is a native decentralized lending protocol built on Base ecosystem with 4x4 tokenomics.&#x20;

YieldLend takes the best of Curve, Solidly, Aave and Radiant Finance, to create incentives that survive long-term growth but is short-term sustainable.

With well designed tokenomics and a community driven fair launch, YieldLend strives to create a sustainable decentralized money market that can out-do other lending markets.

Yield lend builds on top of the:

* **veTokenomics of Curve/Solidly**: Users can stake their YIELD tokens anywhere from 2 weeks to 4 years to have a vested interest in the ecosystem. The more tokens they stake, the bigger the share of rewards they earn.
* **Reward Vesting Mechanics from Radiant Finance:** Users that earn rewards from the protocol in various forms such as staking, farming etc. have their rewards vested. Rewards can be withdrawn early (with a penalty) or staked for 4 years (with a bonus).
* **Money market from Aave:** Users provide liquidity into the money market which is based on Aave v3 to perform basic lending and borrowing. Providing liquidity not only earns incentives, but also generates revenue for the protocol.

## Why Another Lending Protocol?

YieldLend attempts to address a incentive problem with existing lending protocols on Base.

To grow liquidity, protocols need to give out emissions but unfortunately many projects on Base have either poor tokenomics, no long-term incentives or strong short-term revenue sources.

YieldLend fixes this by:

1. Have a diverse lending market with support for many different assets. YieldLend currently has the most number of assets listed for lend/borrow.
2. Launching a fair-launched governance token (YIELD) with no team/VC allocation.
3. Creating incentives to hold YIELD long term (Such as 4-year staking, staking bonuses and penalties for early withdrawal).
4. Generating revenue from taxes and the lending market. Revenue generated from the protocol is used to continuously buyback and burn YIELD, increasing liquidity and making YIELD more scarce..

## Key Features of YIELD

Below we briefly summarize what makes the YIELD token special. To learn more about YIELD and the dynamics of it, you can visit the tokenomics section where each feature is explain in detail.

1. **Fair Launch with Bonding Curve:** Early **u**sers that provide liquidity and participate in the protocol's bonding curve launch, will earn the YIELD governance token. To raise liquidity for the YIELD governance token, a bonding curve sale will be conducted. [Learn More.](tokenomics/bonding-curve-sale.md)
2. **Deflationary Tax Token:** The protocol is incentivized with the YIELD governance token, a deflationary tax token that uses funds to add to improve protocol liquidity and perform burns. [Learn More.](tokenomics/taxes-and-fees.md)
3. **Vesting for Rewards:** Rewards earned from the protocol are vested linearly across a period of 6 months. [Learn More.](tokenomics/vesting.md)
4. **4 Year Staking:** To help in creating scarcity and long-term interest in the protocol, users can participate in the protocol's 4 year staking program. [Learn More.](tokenomics/vetokenomics.md)
