# Welcome

YieldLend is a lending protocol built on Base with veMeme tokenomics. YieldLend takes the best of Curve, Radiant Finance and Memecoin tokenomics, to create strong incentives that survive long-term growth.

With well designed tokenomics and a community driven fair launch, YieldLend strives to create a sustainable decentralized money market that can out-do other lending markets.

Yield lend builds on top of:

* **veTokenomics of Curve/Solidly**: Users can stake their YIELD tokens anywhere from 2 weeks to 4 years to have a vested interest in the ecosystem. The more tokens they stake, the bigger the share of rewards they earn.
* **Reward Vesting Mechanics from Radiant Finance:** Users that earn rewards from the protocol in various forms such as staking, farming etc. have their rewards vested. Rewards can be withdrawn early (with a penalty) or staked for 4 years (with a bonus).
* **Tax-tokenomics from Memecoins:** Users that trade the YIELD token pay a 5% tax on every sell that is used to contribute to token liquidity, increase token scarcity and generate revenue.
* **Money market from Aave:** Users provide liquidity into the money market which is based on Aave v3 to perform basic lending and borrowing. Providing liquidity not only earns incentives, but also generates revenue for the protocol.

## Why Another Lending Protocol?

YieldLend attempts to address an incentive problem with existing DeFi protocols.

To grow liquidity, DeFi protocols need to give out rewards to attract capital but unfortunately many projects on have inflationary tokenomics that incentivize predatory capital and a long-term decline in price. Hence, most DeFi protocols (whilst innovative) typically have a price chart that looks like this.

On the other hard, Memecoins have deflationary tokenomics that attract short term interest, but quickly die down because they don't have any real utility (other than the meme/community itself).

YieldLend innovates here with a very simple solution. By incentivizing liquidity with deflationary tokenomics.

| Inflationary Mechanics                                     | Deflationary Mechanics                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| YIELD is given out as rewards to incentivize liquidity     | 1% of YIELD is burnt every time a user sells YIELD on an exchange                      |
| YIELD is used to incentivize holders to stake their tokens | Revenue from the protocol is used to buyback and burn YIELD from the market.           |
|                                                            | Users who stake their rewards (locking tokens from the supply) are given a 20% bonus.  |
|                                                            | All rewards are vested (3 month vesting) with penalties for early withdrawals.         |



1. Have a diverse lending market with support for many different assets. YieldLend currently has the most number of assets listed for lend/borrow on Base.
2. Launching a fair-launched governance token (YIELD) with no team/VC allocation.
3. Creating incentives to hold YIELD long term (Such as 4-year staking, staking bonuses and penalties for early withdrawal).
4. Generating revenue from taxes and the lending market. Revenue generated from the protocol is used to continuously buyback and burn YIELD, increasing liquidity and making YIELD more scarce..

## Key Features of YIELD

Below we briefly summarize what makes the YIELD token special. To learn more about YIELD and the dynamics of it, you can visit the tokenomics section where each feature is explain in detail.

1. **Fair Launch with Bonding Curve:** Early **u**sers that provide liquidity and participate in the protocol's bonding curve launch, will earn the YIELD governance token. To raise liquidity for the YIELD governance token, a bonding curve sale will be conducted. [Learn More.](tokenomics/bonding-curve-sale.md)
2. **Deflationary Tax Token:** The protocol is incentivized with the YIELD governance token, a deflationary tax token that uses funds to add to improve protocol liquidity and perform burns. [Learn More.](tokenomics/taxes-and-fees.md)
3. **Vesting for Rewards:** Rewards earned from the protocol are vested linearly across a period of 6 months. [Learn More.](tokenomics/vesting.md)
4. **4 Year Staking:** To help in creating scarcity and long-term interest in the protocol, users can participate in the protocol's 4 year staking program. [Learn More.](tokenomics/vetokenomics.md)
