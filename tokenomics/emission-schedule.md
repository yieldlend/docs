The YIELD token is a fair launched token with no team allocations, no VCs, no influencers and no insider supply. The purpose of YIELD is provide economic incentives that grow the entire protocol and it's community.

The YIELD token's distribution focuses on three principles that drive it's growth.

* Grow the lending protocol's liquidity with emissions
* Stake more tokens and create long term holders with staking rewards
* Create scarcity with buyback & burns
