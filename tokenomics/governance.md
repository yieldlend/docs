# Governance

The most powerful use-case for YIELD holders is governance. Users can participate in the protocol's governance by staking YIELD.

As the protocol matures, all decisions made by the protocol will be transferred from the deployed multisig over to the protocol Governance.&#x20;

Voting power is determined by the [veTokenomics](vetokenomics.md) stake and any user is able to place a vote to make changes to the protocol.
