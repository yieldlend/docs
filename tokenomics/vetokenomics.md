# veTokenomics

Similar to Solidly and Curve, users can lock their YIELD tokens anywhere from 2 weeks to 4 years. Locks are represented as NFTs which can then be traded on secondary markets. This page talks in detail how the veTokenomics works.

## Voting Power Model

The veTokenomics framework introduces flexibility in establishing voting power through its vesting period. The duration during which tokens are locked up, referred to as the vote-escrowed period and denoted by the "ve" prefix, can exhibit variability. This variation adheres to a linear relationship, as illustrated below.

Aligned with the principles of veTokenomics, an extended vesting period corresponds to an augmented voting power (voting weight) and increased rewards for holders of $weYIELD. This incentivizes prolonged commitment and active participation within the YieldLend community.

This table showcases how voting power is calculated based on how much YIELD is locked and for how long

| YIELD Locked | Duration | Voting Power   |
| ------------ | -------- | -------------- |
| 10,000       | 4 years  | 10,000 weYIELD |
| 10,000       | 3 years  | 7,500 weYIELD  |
| 10,000       | 2 years  | 5,000 weYIELD  |
| 10,000       | 1 year   | 2,500 weYIELD  |
| 10,000       | 6 months | 1,250 weYIELD  |
| 40,000       | 1 year   | 10,000 weYIELD |

The longer the user vests, the more voting power they get. The more YIELD they vest, the more voting power they get.
