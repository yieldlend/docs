# Tokenomics

## Key Features of YIELD

Below we briefly summarize what makes the YIELD token special. To learn more about YIELD and the dynamics of it, you can visit the tokenomics page where each section is explain in detail.

1. **Fair Launch with Bonding Curve:** Early **u**sers that provide liquidity and participate in the protocol's bonding curve launch, will earn the YIELD governance token. To raise liquidity for the YIELD governance token, a bonding curve sale will be conducted.
2. **Deflationary Tax Token:** The protocol is incentivized with the YIELD governance token, a deflationary tax token that uses funds to add to improve protocol liquidity and perform burns.
3. **Vesting for Rewards:** Rewards earned from the protocol are vested linearly across a period of 6 months.
4. **4 Year Staking:** To help in creating scarcity and long-term interest in the protocol, users can participate in the protocol's 4 year staking program.&#x20;
