# Bonding Curve Sale

The YIELD bonding curve is designed to give participants who provide liquidity early on to the protocol to get a share of the YIELD token but also at the same time raise the liquidity needed to successfully launch the YIELD token on a DEX such as SushiSwap or Aerodrome.

Details about the YIELD bonding curve are as follows.

* **Percentage of YIELD supply in the bonding curve sale:** 30%
* **Soft cap fully diluted valuation (FDV):** $400,000 (50 ETH raised)
* **Hard cap fully diluted valuation (FDV):** $5,000,000 (625 ETH raised)
* **Fundraise distribution:**
  * 80% of the ETH raised will go towards providing liquidity to the YIELD/ETH LP pair.
  * 20% of the ETH raised will go towards a multi-sig for marketing and operations.

## How will the Bonding curve will work

The following curve elaborates how the valuation will work, based on the amount of ETH raised.&#x20;

If the sale reaches the 50 ETH soft cap, then about 28% of the raise will be complete and the FDV of YIELD on launch will be 400,000$. The more ETH that is committed to the sale, the higher the launch price and deeper the liquidity on launch.

This table elaborates the curve and the various targets that the bonding curve sale could hit. (Assuming the price of ETH is 2000$ and 80% of the raise is added LP)
