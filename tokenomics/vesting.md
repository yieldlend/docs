# Vesting

All emissions and inflation of YIELD go through a 3 month linear vesting. This includes staking rewards, bonding curve sale, emissions and any other kind of rewards.

The vesting token for YIELD is the vYIELD token, which is non-tradable ERC20 token deployed on 0x0.  vYIELD can be burnt for YIELD tokens which can be traded in the open market.

## **Early Exit**&#x20;

Users who would like to withdraw their YIELD tokens early can do so but will have to pay a penalty of 25-90% based on a linear schedule of the elapsed time. YIELD charged in the penalty is burnt away from the supply.
