# Vesting

All emissions and inflation of YIELD go through a 3 month linear vesting. This includes staking rewards, bonding curve sale, emissions and any other kind of rewards.

The vesting token for YIELD is the vYIELD token, which is non-tradable ERC20 token deployed on 0x0.  vYIELD can be burnt for YIELD tokens which can be traded in the open market.

## **Early Exit**&#x20;

Users who would like to withdraw their YIELD tokens early can do so but will have to pay a penalty of 25-90% based on a linear schedule of the elapsed time. YIELD charged in the penalty is burnt away from the supply.

## 20% Staking Bonus

Users also have the option to convert their 6 month vest directly into a 4 year stake and start earning staking rewards. Users that opt to do this will earn an extra 20% bonus on their staked amount.

eg: John has 6000 YIELD that is vesting for 6 months. He claimed some tokens but decides he would rather stake these tokens and start earning staking rewards. John chooses the bonus and converts his 6000 YIELD into 7200 weYIELD NFT that is staked for 4 years.

This bonus is given to incentivize long-term holders in the project. This bonus is valid as long as there ie enough YIELD tokens in the bonus pool.
